# Quotes to Live By **ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸**

This project displays a random quote over a randomly chosen background image, creating a design reminiscent of an Instagram post, with a square-shaped image and card-style layout.

## Project Goal

Working with the Pexels API was challenging at first, as it was my first experience with this API. Initially, I struggled to understand the response structure, but after reading the documentation and researching, I was able to parse the response to retrieve the image, the creatorâ€™s information, and the link to view the image on Pexels. Apart from that, this project served as a straightforward front-end exercise.

## Lessons learned & challenges

The biggest challenge was working with the Pexels API. I initially got it working on the first day, but eventually, I couldn't retrieve images anymore. As a workaround, I decided to create an array of images and randomly select one from it.

## How to use

## Notes

This project uses [Quotable](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable) for the quotes. I stopped using Pexels API because it was stopped working for some reason.
