# Quotes to Live By **ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸**

This project displays a random quote over a randomly chosen background image, creating a design reminiscent of an Instagram post, with a square-shaped image and card-style layout.

## Project Goal

Working with the Pexels API was challenging at first, as it was my first experience with this API. Initially, I struggled to understand the response structure, but after reading the documentation and researching, I was able to parse the response to retrieve the image, the creatorâ€™s information, and the link to view the image on Pexels. Apart from that, this project served as a straightforward front-end exercise.

## Lessons learned & challenges

The biggest challenge was working with the Pexels API. I initially got it working on the first day, but eventually, I couldn't retrieve images anymore. As a workaround, I decided to create an array of images and randomly select one from it.
The Quotable API was also functional at first, but it seemed to have SSL issues, so I decided to create an array for the quotes as well.

## How to use

You can see this project in action on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/JoaoGomes/pen/NWQEKVj).

## Notes

I decided not to use APIs in this project anymore. It was simpler to just create arrays and select a random element from them.
