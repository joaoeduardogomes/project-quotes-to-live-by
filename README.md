# Quotes to Live By **ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸**

This project displays a random quote over a randomly chosen background image, creating a design reminiscent of an Instagram post, with a square-shaped image and card-style layout.

## Project Goal

Working with the Pexels API was challenging at first, as it was my first experience with this API. Initially, I struggled to understand the response structure, but after reading the documentation and researching, I was able to parse the response to retrieve the image, the creatorâ€™s information, and the link to view the image on Pexels. Apart from that, this project served as a straightforward front-end exercise.

## Lessons learned & challenges

The Pexels API requests were quite challenging. It was my first time dealing with this API and I wasn't understanding at first. But with a bit of documentation reading and researching I was able to get the returned object with all the useful data: the image itself, the image's owner and the link for visualizing the image on Pexels website.
Apart from that, It was just a front-end website building exercise.
